# Citi Bike Analytics

## Phenomena

- Map of all stations with visual indication of most popular start and end locations shows that popular starting and ending locations differ.  This implies that bikes must be ferried back from ending locations to replenish starting locations.
- The breakdown by gender, age and customer/subscriber shows that outreach efforts have not been effective in shifting the balance among those groups.
- A timeline of bike utilization shows that some bikes are used more often than others.  This implies that bike servicing and replacement may be hapazard.
- A timeline of ridership shows an uneven distribution over time, with summer and winter being the peak and low.  This implies seasonal staffing.
